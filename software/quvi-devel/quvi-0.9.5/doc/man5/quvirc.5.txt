NAME
----
quvirc - The simple configuration file for the quvi program

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A quvi configuration file consists of groups of key-value pairs similar
to the so called .ini-like configuration files. quvi uses the GLib to
parse the configuration. GLib refers to these files as 'key files', for
lack of a better name.

The lines beginning with a '#' are considered as comments. You can
annotate your configuration file using this character. All text after
the comment character to the end of the line is ignored.

GKeyFile has some limitations that should be considered when you use a
configuration file to configure quvi.

Multiple keys::
  Each group in each configuration file may contain the same key
  multiple times, note however that the last key value replaces the
  previously defined value.

Multiple groups::
  Configuration files may contain multiple groups with the same file,
  they are however, merged together.

The syntax of the configuration file is described in detail in the
Desktop Entry Specification at
http://freedesktop.org/Standards/desktop-entry-spec

GKeyFile is described in detail in the GLib reference documentation at
http://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Key-value-file-parser.html

PATHS
-----
The program will by default search the quvirc file from the typical
configuration file paths. These paths (order and location) are
determined by GLib, based on how it was configured.

* Print the search paths:
+
----
$ quvi info --print-config-paths
/usr/share/gnome/quvi/quvirc
/usr/share/gdm/quvi/quvirc
/usr/local/share/quvi/quvirc
/usr/share/quvi/quvirc
/home/legatvs/.local/share/quvi/quvirc
/home/legatvs/.config/quvi/quvirc
----

Each of the same group variable value read from another quvirc
replaces the current value. For example:

----
~/.local/share/quvi/quvirc
[core]
stream = foo

~/.config/quvi/quvirc
[core]
stream = bar
----

The program would use "bar" as the core.stream value.

EXAMPLES
--------
A given quvirc could look like:

----
[core]
check-mode-offline = true
print-format = json
subtitle-language = cc_en,tts_en
stream = 480p,720p,best
#verbosity = debug

[dump]
query-metainfo = true

[exec]
enable-stdout = true
external = echo %t,mplayer %u

[get]
output-regex = %t:/\\w|\\s/,%t:s/\\s\\s+/ /
output-name = %t_%i.%e
resume-from = -1
throttle = 500

[http]
#user-agent = foo/1.0
enable-cookies = true
