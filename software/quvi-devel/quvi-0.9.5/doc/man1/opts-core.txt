  Do not resolve URL redirections before passing the URL to the
  linkman:libquvi-scripts[7] to determine whether the URL is accepted by
  any of the scripts.

-B, --print-subtitles::
  Query and print the available media subtitles. See also

-S, --print-streams::
  Query and print the available media streams. See also
  '--print-format'.

-l, --subtitle-language PATTERN[,PATTERN,...]::
  Match a subtitle language using a regex PATTERN. The value may be a
  comma-separated list of regex PATTERNs (left-to-right order) that
  are matched against the available selection.
  +
  The value may also contain the reserved keyword 'croak' which will
  cause linkman:libquvi[3] to exit with an error when reached.

NOTE: The first available subtitle language will be chosen if nothing
      matched the PATTERN

  config: core.subtitle-language=<PATTERN[,PATTERN,...]>

-s, --stream PATTERN[,PATTERN,...]::
  Match a stream using a regex PATTERN. The value may be a
  comma-separated list of regex PATTERNs (left-to-right order) that
  are matched against the available selection.
  +
The value may contain the following reserved keywords:
+
- 'croak' - instructs linkman:libquvi[3] to exit with an error when reached
- 'best'  - instructs linkman:libquvi[3] to choose the best quality stream

+
The 'best' quality is determined by the linkman:libquvi-scripts[7] by
comparing the media quality properties, e.g. the video height property,
although the actual method may vary depending on the data provided by
the media hosting service.

NOTE: The first available stream is selected if nothing matched

  config: core.stream=<PATTERN[,PATTERN,...]>
