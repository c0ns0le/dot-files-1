NAME
----
quvi-scan - The dumbed-down embedded media URL scanner

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'quvi scan' [OPTIONS] [ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command scans the input URLs for embedded media URLs and prints
them to the stdout. The support is determined by the current selection
of linkman:libquvi-scripts[7].

DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR
-----------------
The command passes the contents of the specified URLs to the 'scan'
scripts of the linkman:libquvi-scripts[7] which will then search the
contents for embedded media URLs.

By default, the command will print the found media URLs in the "rfc2483"
format.  The '--print-format' may be used to change this.
