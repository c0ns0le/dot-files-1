  These are my dot files.  I keep them all in one folder and have symlinks to
them from the original locations.  The actual filenames don't include the
leading dot.  This is for visibility and it's slightly more convenient managing
the files with git that way.

Example:

  $HOME/.vimrc -> $HOME/dot.files/vim/vimrc.josh


To install:

  ./setup

    ...or...

  sh setup


# TO DO

* __Compile Script__ - Write a script that will take all the organized config
  files and inject them inline when they are sourced to create 1 all-inclusive
  dotfile.
    * For example, all of my .bashrc.* files will result in a single
      ".bashrc.compiled" file.
